I build systems that learn — from transformer architectures to full RAG pipelines. Currently finishing my BSc in Software Engineering, and spending most of my time deep inside research papers, PyTorch internals, and the occasional segmentation mask.

## What I'm Working On

Things I've built that I'm proud of:

- **3D Brain Tumor Segmentation** — TransUNet architecture with a transformer bottleneck on BraTS 2023. Achieved 85.76% mean Dice score across three tumor subregions. Built entirely from scratch, including Generalized Dice Loss to handle severe class imbalance.

- **Transformer-Based Machine Translation (Urdu ↔ English)** — Implemented the full transformer architecture from scratch in PyTorch — attention, masking, embeddings, positional encoding. Scraped and processed 30K Wikipedia articles with a custom tokenizer. I can explain every architectural decision.

- **Autograd Engine** — Built PyTorch's autograd from first principles in pure Python. Computational graphs, topological sort, backpropagation, SGD. Trained XOR to a 0.0002 loss. This one taught me more than any course.

- **Research Paper Q&A System (RAG)** — Full-stack system with a dual-retriever architecture for paper discovery + focused Q&A. LangChain, Pinecone, Next.js. Built for extensibility.
